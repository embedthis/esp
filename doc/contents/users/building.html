            <h1>Building ESP Applications</h1>
            <p>ESP applications are comprised of ESP layouts, content pages, partial pages, stylesheets, client-side
            Javascripts, images, databases and server-side controllers. To build an ESP application involves 
            selecting, preparing and processing each of these elements into their final form.</p>

            <p>The essential steps in building ESP applications are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Templating &mdash; Insert page layouts and partial pages into content pages to create composite pages.</li>
                <li>Compile &mdash; ESP pages and controllers into machine code and save as shared libraries.</li>
                <li>Transform &mdash; Content and resources into desired final formats.</li>
                <li>Select files &mdash; Select appropriate file versions and formats (minified or not).</li>
                <li>Post Process &mdash; Compress files.</li>
                <li>Package &mdash; Bundle and package application for deployment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>One Step Building</h2>
            <p>The ESP web framework provides an integrated way to easily build ESP applications with a one step command. 
            If you started your application with an ESP skeleton, you will be already configured to use the
            <a href="https://embedthis.com/expansive">Expansive</a> web site manager to build your ESP application.
            Expansive provides comprehensive support for all the steps required to build a web or ESP application.</p> 

            <p>You do not have to use Expansive to build if you do not wish to. There are other 3rd party 
            web tooling programs that can be used. You can use these tools and then invoke the <em>esp compile</em> 
            command to compile the ESP pages and controllers in your web application.</p>

            <p>To build an ESP application using <a href="https://embedthis.com/expansive">Expansive</a>, use the
            <em>expansive render</em> command. For example:</p>

            <pre class="code">$ <b>expansive render</b>
    [Render] dist/index.esp
    [Render] dist/post/edit.esp
    [Render] dist/post/list.esp
    [Render] dist/css/all.css
      [Post] compile-esp
   [Compile] esp compile
      [Info] Rendered 5 files to "dist". Elapsed time 0.56 secs.</pre>

            <p>To see all the steps performed, run with the <em>-v</em> verbose switch.</p>
            <pre class="code">$ <b>expansive -v render</b></pre>

            <h2>Compiling</h2>
            <a id="compiling"></a>
            <p> During development ESP will automatically compile controllers and web pages in response to 
            client requests &mdash; this happens transparently. Despite the fact that ESP pages and controllers are 
            <em>C</em> code, ESP will deliver "script-like" functionality and if ESP pages or controllers are modified, 
            they will be quickly and automatically recompiled and reloaded. For production releases, however, you 
            typically want to pre-build the application to eliminate the cost of compiling.</p>

            <p>The <em>esp</em> command builds the application's ESP pages and controllers via 
            <em>esp compile</em>. This will compile the ESP controllers and web pages and save as machine code
            binary in shared libraries. When the application is run, it will load the shared libraries for the 
            relevant controllers or web pages from the <em>cache</em> directory without delay.</p>

            <pre class="code">$ <b>esp compile</b></pre>

            <p>This will compile and link all controllers and pages and save the generated shared libraries (DLLs)
            in the <em>cache</em> directory. If you are using Expansive, you will normally not need to run 
            <em>esp compile</em> as <em>expansive</em> will do that for you.</p>

            <h3>Compile Filters</h3>
            <p>If <em>esp compile</em> is run with one or more paths on the command line, these paths will act as 
            filters such that only the designated paths will be compiled. For example:</p>

            <pre class="code">
$ <b>esp compile web/test.esp</b>
$ <b>esp compile myapp</b>
$ <b>esp compile views</b>
$ <b>esp compile /path/to/my/app</b>
$ <b>esp compile /directory/of/apps</b>
</pre>
            <p>These paths are interpreted as filenames relative to the current directory.
            If a controller, web page filename is provided, only that resource will be compiled. If a directory that 
            is part of an MVC application is provided, then all resources under that directory will be compiled. 
            If a directory that is a parent directory of ESP applications or web pages, then all those
            resources contained by that directory will be compiled.</p>

            <p>You may also use the <em>--routeName</em> or <em>--routePrefix</em> switches to select a specific ESP route.
            Then only the resources managed by that route will be compiled.</p>

            <h3>Custom Compiler Options</h3>
            <p>If you have custom compiler flags or libraries, you can pass these to <em>esp</em> by defining the CFLAGS
            environment variable. For example:</p>

            <pre class="code">$ CFLAGS="-DMY_MODE=test -lmylib" <b>esp compile</b></pre>

            <p>This same approach will work for Expansive.</p>
            <pre class="code">$ CFLAGS="-DMY_MODE=test -lmylib" <b>expansive render</b></pre>

<!--
            <h3>Static Linking</h3>
            <p>When using dynamic linking, ESP automatically invokes the necessary initializers when running
            ESP pages or invoking ESP controllers. However, if you are using static linking, you need to take some
            extra manual steps. If you are using static linking, use the <em>--static</em> switch to generate 
            archive libraries instead of shared libraries. You must then manually call the ESP initializers for pages
            and controllers. You can generate the necessary initialization calls via the esp <em>--genlink
            slink.c</em> switch. The generated code should be linked with your main program replacing the default
            slink.c file.</p>

            <pre class="code">$ <b>esp --static --genlink slink.c</b></pre>
-->

            <a id="rules"></a>
            <h2>Compilation Rules</h2>
            <p>ESP includes a pre-configured set of compilation commands for major operating systems. 
            These are represented as compile and link templates in the <em>/usr/local/lib/esp-compile.json</em>. 
            This file is located at <em>/Program Files/Embedthis ESP/bin</em> on windows. If you need to use
            different compilation options, you can modify this file. Here is a portion:</p>

            <pre class="code">
{
    macosx: {
        compile: '${CC} -c ${DEBUG} -Wall -DPIC -fPIC -arch &rarr;
                  ${GCC_ARCH} -I. -I${APPINC} -I${INC} ${SRC} -o ${OBJ}'
    }
}
</pre>
            <p>A better approach than modifying the standard file is to copy it and specify the new file in 
            the <em>esp.compile</em> property in your application's <em>esp.json</em> file. For example:</p>
            <pre class="code">
{
    "esp": {
        "compile": "/path/to/my/esp-compile.json"
    }
}</pre>

            <p>The various <em>{tokens}</em> are expanded at runtime. The <em>esp-compile.json</em>
            configuration file has conditional sections for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and VxWorks.</p>

            <h3>Keep Source</h3>
            <p>When compiling ESP pages, the <em>http.keep</em> property in the <em>esp.json</em> file directive 
            will determine if the generated <em>C</em> source code for ESP pages is preserved after compilation. 
            This can sometimes be helpful for debugging. You also preserve the generated source via the 
            <em>esp --keep compile</em> option.</p> 
            
            <a name="target"></a>
            <h2>Building for Target Systems</h2>
            <p>If your target production system is of a different machine architecture or operating system to that
            of your development system, you will need to either:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cross-compile on your development system for the target system.</li>
                <li>Compile the ESP controllers and pages on the target system.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Compiling on the Target</h3>
            <p>You can re-compile a built ESP application on the target by invoking <em>esp compile</em> on the
            target. This will compile all ESP controllers and pages for the target architecture. 
            If using Appweb, remember to use <em>appesp compile</em>.</p>

            <h3>Cross-compiling</h3>
            <p>If cross-compiling, you must specify the target platform architecture when compiling ESP pages
            and controllers and then link against a cross-compiled version of ESP for the required target
            architecture. This means you must build ESP from source for that target, and when compiling ESP 
            applications you can specify the target platform via the <em>--platform</em> switch. For example:</p>

            <pre class="code">$ <b>esp --platform vxworks-arm-debug compile</b></pre>

            <p>This will compile the application for VxWorks on Arm. Of course, the resulting module cannot be 
            run on the development system if cross-compiling.</p>
            
            <p>The <em>--platform</em> option will search the current directory and parent directories for an ESP 
            platform directory of the same name. You can provide a full path name as an argument to the 
            <em>--platform</em> switch if your application is outside the ESP source tree.</p>
            
            <p>If using Expansive to build, you can define the <em>services.compile-esp.command</em> property in the
            <em>expansive.json</em> file to set the compilation command used by <em>esp</em>. For example:</p>
            <pre class="code">{
  services: {
    "compile-esp": {
      command: 'esp --platform vxworks-arm-debug compile'
    }
  }
}</pre>
        <h2>Debugging and Optimizing</h2>
        <p>When development, you often want ESP controllers and pages to be compiled with symbolic debug 
        information. However, for production release, you want compilation to be optimized without debug symbols.
        The optimization setting can be controlled via the <em>esp.optimize</em> property in <em>esp.json</em>. 
        Set this to <em>true</em> to enable optimization for a production release. Set to <em>false</em> to
        compile with symbolic debug symbols. Defaults to <em>false</em>.</p>

        <code class="inverted">esp: {
    optimize: true
}</code>

        <h2>Bundling and Packaging</h2>
        <p>For deployment in a production environment, it optimal to compile the entire application including
        all controllers, views and web pages into a single library. This is referred to as <em>combining</em> 
        the application and is enabled by setting the <em>esp.combine</em> property in <em>esp.json</em> to true.</p>

        <code class="inverted">esp: {
    combine: true
}</code>
        <p>This will catenate all the controller and view page source into a single file. This is then compiled
        into a single library. This source file will contain a single initializer function:
        <em>esp_app_NAME_combine</em> that will register all your controller actions and view pages. If you are using
        static linking, you must call this function from your main program. For example:</p>
        <pre class="code">
ESP_EXPORT int esp_app_kickstart_combine(HttpRoute *route, MprModule *module) {
    esp_controller_kickstart_port(route, module);
    esp_view_b839216b9138e38baf8851c81761c2d5(route, module);
    return 0;
}
</pre>

            <a id="cleaning"></a>
            <h2>Cleaning</h2>
            <p>To clean files under the cache directory:</p>

            <pre class="code">$ <b>esp clean</b></pre>
