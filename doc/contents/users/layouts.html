            <h1>ESP Layouts</h1>
            <p>Highly usable applications have consistent structure, menus and appearance so the user can easily 
            navigate that application. Such applications may consist of many web pages that share a common look
            and feel.  However, designing and maintaining that consistency is sometimes a challenge.</p>
            
            <p>ESP uses the <a href="http://embedthis.com/expansive/">Expansive</a> tool to provide a powerful and flexible solution for implementing a consistent UI via layout pages.
            Layouts pages define the look and feel of an application while content pages provide page specific
            content. HTML pages are then rendered to clients by merging content pages with one or more layout pages. 
            This creates a composite page for what the user will actually see. In this way, a web application 
            can easily maintain a consistent look and feel without repeating boilerplate code from page to page. 
            ESP believes strongly in the DRY principle: <em>"Don't Repeat Yourself"</em>. </p>
            
            <img class="centered" src="../images/esp/template/layout.jpg" alt="layout" />
            <p>For example: consider the layout page below named "<em>layouts/default.esp</em>". This will will
            define the top level HTML layout page for content pages. It has a banner image and division tags that 
            structure the page:</p>
            <pre class="code">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="top"&gt;
        &lt;img src="banner.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="content"&gt;
        <b>&lt;&#64; content &#64;&gt;</b>
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
            <p>Modifications to this page, will be reflected automatically in all content pages.</p>
            
            <a id="content"></a>
            <h3>Content Pages</h3>
            <p>A content page defines only the HTML and code that is unique for a specific page. It is merged with a
            layout page by inserting the content and replacing the <em>&lt;&#64; content &#64;&gt;</em> tag in the layout
            page before rendering to the client.</p>
            <p>For example, consider the content page named "<em>demo-index.esp</em>":</p>
            <pre class="code">
<b>&lt;h1&gt;Content Page&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;</b>
</pre>
            <p>This would render a composite web page back to the user:</p>
            <pre class="code">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="top"&gt;
        &lt;img src="banner.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="content"&gt;
        <b>&lt;h1&gt;Content Page&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;</b>
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
            <p>Note that the blending of layout and content page happens only once and the result is save under
            the "documents" directory. For more information, read the
            <a href="https://embedthis.com/expansive/doc/">Expansive Documentation</a>.</p>

            <h3>Include Pages</h3>
            <p>Sometimes you need to just include some arbitrary HTML file at any point in a page. Use the <em>
            include</em> directive at any point in the page you wish to include another file. For example:</p>
            <pre class="code">&lt;&#37;@ include "common/header.html" &#37;&gt;</pre>

  <a id="pipeline"></a>
            <h3>ESP Pipeline</h3>
            <p>The ESP pipeline processes ESP pages to generate client responses. The process begins with
            with an HTML page which typically, though not always, contains embedded <em>C</em> code. This is
            parsed by the ESP Template Engine and combined with layout pages to create a single composite web page. 
            This is then converted to pure <em>C</em> code that is compiled, linked and saved as a native-code shared library. 
            The library is loaded and the code run whenever a client request is received for that page. If the web page
            or template is modified, the pipeline recompiles the page and regenerates the code library.</p>
            <p>This entire pipeline process happens transparently in the background with only a momentary pause in 
            processing. For production, you can pre-compile web pages so that a compiler is not required on the target.</p>
            
            <img src="../images/esp/template/layout.jpg" alt="View Pipeline" class="centered" />
            
            <a id= "layouts"></a>
            <h3>Layout Pages</h3>
            <p>Layout pages allow you to define the "look and feel" of the user interface and specify
            the standard elements of all web pages in one place. 
            ESP pages reuse the "look and feel" by simply referencing a layout page.</p>
            <p>The layout page is structurally just an ESP Page that typically contains the top level HTML
            structure, style sheets and graphic content to be included on every page. It may contain embedded <em>C</em> 
            code, and most importantly, it specifies the location to insert content from content pages.</p>
            <p>The ESP content pages supply the content and data that is unique to that page. Content pages 
            do not replicate the layout and look and feel that is specified in the layout page.  In this way, changing
            the layout page in once place will automatically change every web page in the application.</p>
            <p>Here is a simple layout page:</p>
            <pre class="code">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;img src="banner.jpg"&gt;
    <b>&lt;%@ content %&gt;</b>
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
            <p>The <b>&lt;%@ content %&gt;</b> directive instructs the Template Engine to insert the content page at
            this location. </p>
            <p>Here is a simple content page. Note that this is missing the &lt;html&gt; and &lt;body&gt; tags:</p>
            <pre class="code">
&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is &lt;%= mprGetDate(0) %&gt;
</pre>
            <p>ESP pages are not required to use layout pages. To specify that no layout page is required, use an
                empty layout directive in the content page. For example: </p>
                <pre class="code">
&lt;%@ layout "" %&gt;
</pre>
            <p>By default, stand-alone ESP pages do not use a layout page, whereas ESP view pages in an MVC application
            do.</p>


            <p>The <em>&lt;%@ layout "file" %&gt;</em> directive specifies the name of the layout page. By using 
            this directive in layout pages, you can build up the web page layout by nesting layout pages. If omitted 
            in content pages, which is usually the case, the default layout of <em>layouts/default.esp</em> will be used. 
            If omitted in layout pages, it is assumed the layout page is the top level layout page.</p>
            <p>The template engine additionally supports the following web page directive in layout pages:</p>

            <pre class="code">&lt;%@ content %&gt;</pre>

            <p>This specifies the location for the content page data.</p>
            <p>Note: you do not have to use layout pages. Simple stand-alone web pages without layouts code are
            supported. To disable use of a layout page, use a <em>&lt;%@ layout="" %&gt;</em> directive.</p>
